## **NOTE: _No longer maintained_**

This repo was the very first attempt at using Gatsby, trying to learn the tools while converting an older Jekyll site. New repo started from scratch at [https://github.com/baadaa/bald-gatsby](https://github.com/baadaa/bald-gatsby)

# B as in BALD

Personal portfolio, blog, and coding playground for Bumhan Yu, built with Gatsby and React components.

## Folder Structure

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules/
    ├── src/
    │   ├─ components/
    │   ├─ content/
    │   ├─ images/
    │   ├─ pages/
    │   └─ styles/
    └── static/

1.  **`/node_modules`**: Node modules, obviously.

2.  **`/src/`**:

    1. **`components/`**: layout elements, styling components, simple utility functions, etc.

    1. **`content/`**: blog entries, portfolio items, and their image assets

    1. **`images/`**: page-level image assets

    1. **`pages/`**: top level pages

    1. **`styles/`**: base `scss` and `css` files from previous Jekyll site

3.  **`/static`**: PDF and image files for external sharing

## Plans

- Code cleanup

- Remove verbose styling codes

- Otherwise iterate and improve
