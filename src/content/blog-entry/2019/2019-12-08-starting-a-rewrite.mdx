  Wrapping up 2019, I decided to rewrite my portfolio/blog in Gatsby—leaving
  Jekyll behind. This is a personal documentation of why I made the decision and

## Why not Jekyll

  One word: Ruby. Two words: Ruby and Liquid.
</blockquote>

One word: `RUBY`. Two words: `RUBY` and `Liquid`. I am a complete stranger to the language, and have no huge interest in learning it. The only times I interfaced with Ruby was when handling Jekyll sites, and it was not fun. Having to look up _everything_ each time trying to do anything, I often felt inadequate and frustrated. Slow build time didn't bother me as much as the occasional errors that broke the build. Yes, I _could_ have invested more time learning the language. But no, I didn't _want_ to do it.

## Why Gatsby

### Short answer: _JavaScript_

It's something I know and use every day. There's a gazillion packages to take advantage of if I need. It's the familiarity with the tools that hooked me. _Hugo_, written in `GO`, is famous for its incredible speed, but it wasn't as appealing to me for the same reason Jekyll wasn't attractive. With _Gatsby_, everything is just `JavaScript`, and Heck, it doesn't even involve a templating language. I'll still have to fight unexpected errors, but at least won't have to do it in foreign languages.

### Long answer: _React, the new hotness, and the batteries included_

I've been picking up _React_ and _Gatsby_ skills in the past year but my day job doesn't involve writing either. With no real project at hand, my understanding of the tool remained theoretical and basic. I need _a thing_, and a long-dormant portfolio site seemed like _a perfect thing_. Since I first heard its name in 2017, _Gatsby_ has fast become a hot topic. _11ty_ seems fascinating, and perhaps is an arguably better option for a Jekyll alternative.
