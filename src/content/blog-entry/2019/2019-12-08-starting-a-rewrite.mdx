## Jekyll, a love at first sight

It was 2016 when I was first introduced to the static site generator _Jekyll_, which magically turns static assets into a fully rendered website with no server or db setup. By then, there were only two ways I knew how to build a website: 1) handcrafting _every_ page, or 2) use a CMS solution like _Drupal_ or _WordPress_. <small>(_Flash_ had already been long dead by then, so it didn't count.)</small>

It was such a breath of fresh air. Build everything as static files with minimal grunt work. Plus, you can host it for free at GitHub with _almost_ no additional config. What's not to love? In 2017 I decided not to renew the hosting service where I hosted my WordPress portfolio site, and to go fully static with Jekyll at GitHug pages. _This is going to be awesome_, I thought.

## Soon, pain points emerged

Most of its concepts made good sense. Create templates, set up configs, provide content, and run a build command. The initial pains and confusions mostly came from it written in **Ruby**. The concept of `gemfile`s and `bundler` _made sense_ but its syntax was foreign to me. For a `HTML/SCSS/JS` guy like me `ruby` felt rather intimidating.

While inconvenient, I could accept that learning new syntax is part of lerning a new tool. What made it more confusing was the unfortunate timing. `Ruby 2.4.0` and `Jekyll 3.4.x` had recently been released, introducing small, subtle changes which rendered plenty of online references and tutorials marginally useless.

### Ongoing friction

I'm a completely illiterate of Ruby. Their well-documented _quickstart_ guides were not really quickstart for me, because everything was so foreign to me—the installation process, file structure, syntax, and everything. I had to look it up each time I tried to do _anything_. And once I accomplished it by copy-pasting a code block, I

Of course it's part of the process when you learn something new, but as I wasn't—and still am not—using Ruby for anything else, nothing I learned sticked.
