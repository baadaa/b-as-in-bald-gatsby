## Why not Jekyll

  One word: Ruby. Two words: Ruby and Liquid.

One word: `RUBY`. Two words: `RUBY` and `Liquid`. I am a complete stranger to the language, and have no huge interest in learning it. The only times I interfaced with Ruby was when handling Jekyll sites, and it was not fun. Having to look up _everything_ each time trying to do anything, I often felt inadequate and frustrated. Slow build time didn't bother me as much as the occasional errors that broke the build. Yes, I _could_ have invested more time learning the language. But no, I didn't _want_ to do it.

## Why Gatsby

### Short answer: _JavaScript_

It's something I know and use every day. There's a gazillion packages to take advantage of if I need. It's the familiarity with the tools that hooked me. _Hugo_, written in `GO`, is famous for its incredible speed, but it wasn't as appealing to me for the same reason Jekyll wasn't attractive. With _Gatsby_, everything is just `JavaScript`, and Heck, it doesn't even involve a templating language. I'm still going to deal with unexpected errors, but at least won't have to do it in foreign languages.

### Long answer: _React, the new hotness, and the batteries included_

I've been picking up _React_ and _Gatsby_ skills in the past year but my day job doesn't involve writing either. With no real project at hand, my understanding of the tools remained theoretical and basic. I needed _a thing_, and a long-dormant portfolio site seemed like _a perfect thing_. And actually _Gatsby_ appears to be an impeccable tool to build a portfolio site with as it handles SEO, image optimization, responsive assets, and other tedious tasks with minimal efforts. It's an undebatable advantage over other static site generators.

## The plan

A complete redesign is not the goal. This project is primarily to gain _Gatsby_ experience and skills, and secondarily to clean up UX/UI. Other than removing jQuery dependency and adjusting layouts, the changes to the site bahavior and structure will be minimal if at all. I'm excited to learn more about `GraphQL`, SSR, and a variety of other _React_- and _Gatsby_-specific tools, and going to document my learnings along the way.

Toward the end, I look to end up with a platform I can continue to improve and iterate upon, where I could publish my short keep documenting my learnings and post work samples.
