### Concept

<div>

Senses, _especially smell or taste_, can trigger powerful and vivid memories&mdash;_and emotions_&mdash;of the past, as is often referred to as [_involuntary memory_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involuntary_memory) or _the Proust Effect_. Should a childhood comfort food prompt nostalgic emotions, **what if** we could trigger such involuntary memories _voluntarily_?<br /><br />In this conceptual piece, I imagined a _restaurant that serves food to evoke memories and emotions_. A guest chooses a menu, selects the _kind of_ memories to trigger <span style="color:#CCC;">(_like, "I'm in the mood for some bitter-sweet memories today"_)</span>, and gets served with involuntary memory as they eat.<br /><br />[Kaleidoscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaleidoscope) is a metaphoric reference to dream-like yet vivid emotional quality of Proustian moments, and naturally lends itself to kaleidoscopic aesthetics throughout the video to set the tone.
